# Hiveblob

> I haven't begun work on this project yet, but I'd sure like to someday.

This is my exploratory game design project, so there are no firm requirements. Hiveblob is a 2D game survival puzzle game inspired by rainworld and oxygen not included. You control a blob genetically engineered for adaptability, at the expense of... uh... everything else.
